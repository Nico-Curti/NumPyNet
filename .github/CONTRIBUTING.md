## Before start contributing

- If you are going to fix a bug, check that it's still exists and that you are working with the latest version of `NumPyNet` library.

- Make sure that there is not someone working on the same issue. In this case you can provide support or suggestion in the issue.

- If you have any question about the library fill an issue with the same criteria described in the previous step.
